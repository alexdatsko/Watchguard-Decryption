Forked this code for decrypting old Watchguard passwords, PSKs, and other AES ECB encrypted data from older Watchguard WSM XML configuration files using static keys and IVs.  Modified to use PyCryptoDome to be compatible with Python3.  

I also cleaned it up much more and imported it into my API Toolbox project and made a simple web form for it, but that code is proprietary and can not be included here.
